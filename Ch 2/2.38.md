- Q: Describe the differences in type deduction between `decltype` and `auto`. Give an example of an expression where auto and decltype will deduce the same type and an example where they will deduce differing types.

- A: `decltype` returns the type of a variable/expression without actually executing it. 

The way decltype handles top-level const and references differs subtly from the way auto does. Another important difference between decltype and auto is that the deduction done by decltype depends on the form of its given expression.

so the key of difference is subtly and form.

int i = 0, &r = i;
// same
auto a = i;
decltype(i) b = i;
// different "c" will be int "d" will be int&
auto c = r;
decltype(r) d = r;
