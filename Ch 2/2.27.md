 Which of the following initializations are legal? Explain why. 
 (a) int i = -1, &r = 0;            legal, illegal
 (b) int *const p2 = &i2;           legal if `i2` is `const`
 (c) const int i = -1, &r = 0;      legal
 (d) const int *const p3 = &i2;     legal if `i2` is `const`
 (e) const int *p1 = &i2;           legal
 (f) const int &const r2;           illegal because initialization is required (r2 is a reference that cannot be const.)
 (g) const int i2 = i, &r = i;      legal
