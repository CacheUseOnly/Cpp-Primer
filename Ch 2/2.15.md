Which of the following definitions, if any, are invalid? Why? 
    (a) int ival = 1.01;        valid
    (b) int &rval1 = 1.01;      invalid, rhs should be address (initializer must be an object)
    (c) int &rval2 = ival;      valid
    (d) int &rval3;             reference should be initialized when declared
