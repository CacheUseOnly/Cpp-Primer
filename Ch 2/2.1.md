- Q: What are the differences between `int`, `long`, `long long`, and `short`? Between an `unsigned` and a `signed` type? Between a `float` and a `double`? 

- A: 
    1. Their size and max and min value are different.
    2. `signed` type is signed and thus represent a number's positivity and its max value is smaller but range stays the same.
    3. `double` holds longer precision than `float`.
