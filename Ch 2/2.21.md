Explain each of the following definitions. Indicate whether any are illegal and, if so, why. 
`int i = 0;`
(a) double* dp = &i;    legal (illegal, cannot initialize a variable of type 'double *' with an
      rvalue of type 'int *')
(b) int *ip = i;        legal, but the pointer points to address 0 (illegal, cannot initialize a variable of type 'int *' with an lvalue
      of type 'int')
(c) int *p = &i;        legal
