- A: Explain the following definitions. For those that are illegal, explain whatâ€™s wrong and how to correct it. 
    (a) std::cin >> int input_value; 
    (b) int i = { 3.14 }; 
    (c) double salary = wage = 9999.99; 
    (d) int i = 3.14;

- Q: 
    (a) rhs can't be a declaration
    (b) `int` cannot convert to list of double
    (c) incorrect syntax as rhs cannot be lvalue (if you declared 'wage' before, it's right. Otherwise, you'll get a error: error: use of undeclared identifier 'wage')
    (d) `int` cannot convert to `double` (`double` will be truncated to `int`: 3.14 to 3)
