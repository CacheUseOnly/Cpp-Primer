Which of the following are legal? For those that are illegal, explain why. 
```cpp
(a) const int buf;          //legal (illegal, buf is not initialized)
(b) int cnt = 0;            //legal
(c) const int sz = cnt;     //illegal, cannot initialize `const int` with int (legal)
(d) ++cnt; ++sz;            //++cnt legal, ++sz illegal because sz is const
```
