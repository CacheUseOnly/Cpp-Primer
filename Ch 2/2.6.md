- Q: What, if any, are the differences between the following definitions:
 
        int month = 9, day = 7; 
        int month = 09, day = 07;

- A: No difference.
- *Correct Answer: 
    The first line's integer is decimal.

    The second line:

    int month = 09 is invalid, cause octal don't have digit 9.
    day is octal.*
