-  Explain each of the following loops. Correct any problems you detect.
1. ```c++
    do
        int v1, v2;
        cout << "Please enter two numbers to sum:" ;
        if (cin >> v1 >> v2)
            cout << "Sum is: " << v1 + v2 << endl;
    while (cin);
    ```
    no {}
2. ```c++
    do {
    // . . .
    } while (int ival = get_response());
    ```
    should be a conditional statement in `while()`
3. ```c++
    do {
    int ival = get_response();
    } while (ival);
    ```
    `while` cannot access to `ival` scope
