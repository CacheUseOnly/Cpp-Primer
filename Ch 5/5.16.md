- The while loop is particularly good at executing while some condition holds; for example, when we need to read values until end-of-file.
The for loop is generally thought of as a step loop: An index steps through a range of values in a collection. Write an idiomatic use of each loop and then rewrite each using the other loop construct. If you could use only one loop, which would you choose? Why?

    - 
    ```c++
    for (init-statement; condition; step) {}

    equals

    init-statement;
    while(condition) {
        //
        step
    }
    ```
    If to pick one, I'd pick `for` loop for it is optimal when using step looping
