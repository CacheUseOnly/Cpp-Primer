# Q
Based only on the algorithm and argument names, describe
the operation that the each of the following library algorithms performs:

# A
`replace(beg, end, old_val, new_val);`
- replace all element equal to `old_val` with `new_val` from `beg` to `end`

`replace_if(beg, end, pred, new_val);`
- replace elements satisfying `pred` with `new_val` from `beg` to `end`

`replace_copy(beg, end, dest, old_val, new_val);`
- replace `old_val` with `new_val` from `beg` to `end` and copy to `dest`

`replace_copy_if(beg, end, dest, pred, new_val);`
- replace elements satisfying `pred` with `new_val` from `beg` to `end` to `dest`
