  Explain whether the following program fragment is legal.
```cpp
  std::cout << "The sum of " << v1;
            << " and " << v2;
            << " is " << v1 + v2 << std::endl;
```
  If the program is legal, what does it do? 
  If the program is not legal, why not? How would you fix it?

- Answer: this program is not legal because there are unwanted semicolons at the end of each lines, remove them will solve the problem.
