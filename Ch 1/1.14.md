- Q: Compare and contrast the loops that used a for with those using a while. Are there advantages or disadvantages to using either form?

- A:
    - There are actions executing at the beginning and end of `for` loop, which makes it ideal for loop that changes state or with steps. `while` loop, on the contrary, is more simple, so it's best to use for a loop that only check conditions.
