# Q
Which is the most appropriate—a vector, a deque, or a
list—for the following program tasks? Explain the rationale for your choice.
If there is no reason to prefer one or another container, explain why not.

- a
Read a fixed number of words, inserting them in the container
alphabetically as they are entered. We’ll see in the next chapter that
associative containers are better suited to this problem.

array. Since it's fixed number of words, array would be optimized to use

- b
Read an unknown number of words. Always insert new words at the
back. Remove the next value from the front.

deque. It focuses on operations on front/back, thus deque suits it the best

- c
Read an unknown number of integers from a file. Sort the numbers and
then print them to standard output.

Linked list. Since a huge amount of re-position is to be done, a container with 
high flexiblity of modifying data other than front/back is best fitted
