# Q
In the program on page 349 that erased a range of
elements, what happens if elem1 and elem2 are equal? What if elem2 or
both elem1 and elem2 are the off-the-end iterator?
```c++
elem1 = slist.erase(elem1, elem2); // after the call elem1 == elem2
```

# A
1. erase no element, `elem1` remains unchanged
2. erase no element, `elem1` remains unchanged since it's already an off-the-end iterator
