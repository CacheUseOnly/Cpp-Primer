# Q
Explain what the following program fragment does:

```c++
vector<string> svec;
svec.reserve(1024);
string word;
while (cin >> word)
    svec.push_back(word);
svec.resize(svec.size()+svec.size()/2);
```

# A
reserve 1024 elements space and receive input. Then resize it to its 1.5 time size.
> Even if we initially reserved 1024 elements, if there are more words read from cin, our vector's capacity will be automatically increased (most implementations will double the previous capacity) to accommodate them.
