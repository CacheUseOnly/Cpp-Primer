# Q
Assuming iv is a vector of ints, what is wrong with the
following program? How might you correct the problem(s)?
```c++
vector<int>::iterator iter = iv.begin(),
mid = iv.begin() + iv.size()/2;

while (iter != mid)
    if (*iter == some_val)
        iv.insert(iter, 2 * some_val);
```

# A
The iterator will never advance.
```c++
iter = iv.insert(iter, 2 * some_val);
```
