# Q
Explain how the loop from page 345 that used the return
from insert to add elements to a list would work if we inserted into a
vector instead.
```c++
list<string> lst;
auto iter = lst.begin();
while (cin >> word)
iter = lst.insert(iter, word);
```

# A
It will work as well since list and vector's interfaces share similar functionality
