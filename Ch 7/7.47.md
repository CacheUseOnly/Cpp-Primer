# Q
Explain whether the Sales_data constructor that takes a
string should be explicit. What are the benefits of making the
constructor explicit? What are the drawbacks?

# A
Pro:
- eliminate ambiguity so that compiler won't implicit convert parameter resulting unwanted consequence

Con:
- only can be used under strict condition
