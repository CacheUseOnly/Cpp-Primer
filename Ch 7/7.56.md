# Q
What is a static class member? What are the advantages
of static members? How do they differ from ordinary members?

# A
static class member belongs to the class rather than a single instance.
It can be shared among all instances; they can be not initialized even though an instance
is created

- Corrected
a static data member can have incomplete type.
we can use a static member as a default argument.
