# Q
Given the following declarations, determine which calls are legal and which are illegal. For those that are illegal, explain why.

```c++
double calc(double);
int count(const string &, char);
int sum(vector<int>::iterator, vector<int>::iterator, int);
vector<int> vec(10);
```

- `calc(23.4, 55.1);`
    Invalid, incorrect parameter number
- `count("abcda", 'a');`
    Invalid, literal can't be referenced
- `calc(66);`
    Valid, int can be cast to double
- `sum(vec.begin(), vec.end(), 3.8);`
    Invalid, 3.8 can't be inplicitly cast to int
