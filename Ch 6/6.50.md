# Q
Given the declarations for f from page 242, list the viable
functions, if any for each of the following calls. Indicate which function is the
best match, or if the call is illegal whether there is no match or why the call
is ambiguous.
```c++
void f();
void f(int);
void f(int, int);
void f(double, double = 3.14);
```

# A
- f(2.56, 42)
    viable functions are: `f(int, int)` and `f(double, double)`
    ambiguous call.

- f(42)
    viable functions: `f(int)` and `f(double, double = 3.14)`
    `f(int)` is the best match

- f(42, 0)
    `f(int, int)` and `f(double, double)`
    `f(int, int)` is the best match

- f(2.56, 3.14)
    `f(int, int)` and `f(double, double)`
    `f(double, double)` is the best match
