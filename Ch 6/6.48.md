# Q
Explain what this loop does and whether it is a good use of
assert:
```c++
string s;
while (cin >> s && s != sought) { } // empty body
assert(cin);
```

It read `s` from cin until `s` matches `sought`. It is a good use of `asser()` because there are two ways to end this while loop: 1. s == sought, this is the case we want and cin is non-zero; 2. cin ends, this is not how we want the while loop to end; in this case, cin is zero, thus `assert()` will tell us.
