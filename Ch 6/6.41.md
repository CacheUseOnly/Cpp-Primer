# Q
Which, if any, of the following calls are illegal? Why? Which,
if any, are legal but unlikely to match the programmerâ€™s intent? Why?

`char *init(int ht, int wd = 80, char bckgrnd = ' ');`

init();         Illegal, needed parameter for `ht`
init(24,10);    Legal
init(14, '*');  Legal, but `'*'` is passed to `wd`, which unmatches the intent.
