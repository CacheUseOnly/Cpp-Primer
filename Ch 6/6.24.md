# Q
Explain the behavior of the following function. If there are
problems in the code, explain what they are and how you might fix them.
```c++
void print(const int ia[10])
{
    for (size_t i = 0; i != 10; ++i)
        cout << ia[i] << endl;
}
```

# A
It prints out the content of an array. It is unsafe to declare in this way
because any `*int` can be passed to this function. It can be fixed via adding 
a size parameter or rewrite in `const int (&arr)[10]`.
