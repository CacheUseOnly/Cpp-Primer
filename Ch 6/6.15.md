## Q 
Explain the rationale for the type of each of find_charâ€™s
parameters In particular, why is s a reference to const but occurs is a
plain reference? Why are these parameters references, but the char
parameter c is not? What would happen if we made s a plain reference?
What if we made occurs a reference to const?

## A
- why is s a reference to const but occurs is a plain reference?
    `s` is the source this function exams at so you don't want to modify the source. `occurs` is a variable that store the number of occurance so it should be modifiable
- Why are these parameters references, but the char parameter c is not?
    `c` is a temporal variable when calling this function so it should be created
- What would happen if we made s a plain reference? What if we made occurs a reference to const?
    It will be at risk to make `s` modifiable; `occurs` will not be able to receive the return of this function
