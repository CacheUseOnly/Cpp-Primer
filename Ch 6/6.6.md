- Q: Explain the differences between a parameter, a local variable, and a local static variable. Give an example of a function in which each
might be useful.

- A: parameter is an automatic object which is initialized when the function is called; local variable has scope that's only within the function; local static variable is a variable within the scope of a function but is initialized when the program starts and terminated when the program ends.

```c++
int foo(int var);

int main() {

    cons = 0;
    foo(0);
    foo(1);

    return 0;
}

int foo(int var) {
    char c;
    static int cons;

    return ++cons;
}
```
