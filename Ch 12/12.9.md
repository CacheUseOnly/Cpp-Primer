# 12.9

## Q

Exercise 12.9: Explain what happens in the following code:
``` c++
int *q = new int(42), *r = new int(100);
r = q;
auto q2 = make_shared<int>(42), 
    r2 = make_shared<int>(100);
r2 = q2;
```

## A

Allocate memory for `q` and `r`, and assign `q`'s address to `r`. This makes the memory storing `42` lost as no pointer points to it. 

Allocate memory for `q2` and `r2`, and assign `q2`'s address to `r2`. Since they are `shared_ptr`, the memory space `q2` originally points to will be destroyed.
