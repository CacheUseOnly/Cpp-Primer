# 12.5

## Q

We did not make the constructor that takes an
`initializer_list` explicit (§ 7.5.4, p. 296). Discuss the pros and
cons of this design choice.

## A

> ## Pros
>
> The compiler will not use this constructor in an automatic conversion.
> We can realize clearly which class we have used.
>
> ## Cons
>
> We always uses the constructor to construct a temporary StrBlob object.
> cannot use the copy form of initialization with an explicit constructor. not easy to use.
