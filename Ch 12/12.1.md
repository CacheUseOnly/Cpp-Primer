## Q

How many elements do b1 and b2 have at the end of this
code?
```c++
StrBlob b1;
{
    StrBlob b2 = {"a", "an", "the"};
    b1 = b2;
    b2.push_back("about");
}
```

# A

`b2` has zero elements because it goes out of scope; `b1` has four elements because `b2`'s increment is also manifested in `b1` due to  `shared_ptr`
