# 12.8

## Q

Exercise 12.8: Explain what if anything is wrong with the following function.
``` C++
bool b() { 
    int* p = new int;
    // ...
    return p;
}
```

## A

address will not fit in `bool` type, resulting in loss of information. So that the allocated memory cannot be freed properly since you cannot refer to the address.
