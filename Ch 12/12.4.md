## Q

In our check function we didnâ€™t check whether i was
greater than zero. Why is it okay to omit that check?
```c++
void StrBlob::check(size_type i, const string &msg) const
{
    if (i >= data->size())
    throw out_of_range(msg);
}
```

## A

Because a valid `size()` is always greater or equal to zero; if it's a zero, it means the data is null, not a out of range exception.
