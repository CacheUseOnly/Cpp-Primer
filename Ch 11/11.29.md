# Q
What do upper_bound, lower_bound, and
equal_range return when you pass them a key that is not in the container?

# A
`upper_bound` and `lower_bound`: refer to the point at which the key can be inserted without disrupting the order.
`equal_range`: both the first and second iterators refer to the position where this key can be inserted
