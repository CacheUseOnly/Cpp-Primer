# Q
Explain the meaning of the operand pos.first->second
used in the output expression of the final program in this section
```c++
// definitions of authors and search_item as above
// pos holds iterators that denote the range of elements for this key
for (auto pos = authors.equal_range(search_item);
    pos.first != pos.second; ++pos.first)
    cout << pos.first->second << endl; // print each title
```

# A
`pos` is a pair; `pos.first` is the first element of returned pair, which is the beginning of the range;
`pos.first->second` is the value of the beginning of the key range.
