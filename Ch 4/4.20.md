Assuming that iter is a `vector<string>::iterator`, indicate which, if any, of the following expressions are legal. Explain the behavior of the legal expressions and why those that arenâ€™t legal are in error. 
---

(a) *iter++;
    - dereference next element: *(iter++)
(b) (*iter)++; 
    - current element self-increment
(c) *iter.empty() 
    - dereference iter.empty()
(d) iter->empty(); 
    - call member function empty() of iter
(e) ++*iter; 
    - prefix increment of *iter
(f) iter++->empty();
    - call member function empty() iter and proceed to next element
