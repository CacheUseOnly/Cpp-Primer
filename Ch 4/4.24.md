- Q: Our program that distinguished between high pass, pass, and fail depended on the fact that the conditional operator is right associative. Describe how that operator would be evaluated if the operator were left associative.

- A: if the operator were left associative.

`finalgrade = (grade > 90) ? "high pass" : (grade < 60) ? "fail" : "pass";`
would same as :

`finalgrade = ((grade > 90) ? "high pass" : (grade < 60)) ? "fail" : "pass";`
if grade > 90, first conditional operator's result is high pass. so the finalgrade is always fail. It's contradictory obviously.
