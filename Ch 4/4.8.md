- Q: Explain when operands are evaluated in the logical `AND`, logical `OR`, and equality operators
- A: "The logical AND and OR operators always evaluate their left operand before the right. Moreover, the right operand is evaluated if and only if the left operand does not determine the result. This strategy is known as short-circuit evaluation."
