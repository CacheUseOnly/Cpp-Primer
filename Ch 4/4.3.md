- Q: Order of evaluation for most of the binary operators is left undefined to give the compiler opportunities for optimization. This strategy presents a trade-off between efficient code generation and potential pitfalls in the use of the language by the programmer. Do you consider that an acceptable trade-off? Why or why not?

- A: Acceptable. When it's workable, effiency comes first. Whenever the outcome is desired, other ways of coding solve that.
