- Q: Assuming i, j, and k are all ints, explain what i != j < k means.
- A: if i not equal to j, determine if k is larger than 1; if i equals to j, determine if k is larger than 0

---
When the expression `i != j <k` is run, the result of the comparison is first calculated;
The less than symbol is a binary operator, the priority is higher than the judgment, and the operation is performed first;
The meaning of the expression is: compare the operation result of `j<k` with i, i is an integer, so the comparison result will be converted to an integer, that is, 0 or 1 
Compare with i;
